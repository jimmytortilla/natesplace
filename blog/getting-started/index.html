    <p>Though our family has a <a href="https://stratton.life">website</a>, its main purpose is not as a blog but as a newsletter and prayer list.  I also set up another website this past week for our church here in Japan, <a href="https://jimmytortilla.github.io/shiroamu/">Siloam Intl. Christian church</a>&ndash;in Japanese, of course.  Both sites are Github Pages and were built with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> using the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/">Ananke</a> theme.  Through the experience of getting these two sites set up, I found that I really enjoyed writing the updates and that I am always tempted to write too much and off subject.  So why not just start another little site?</p>

<p>At first my simple, little blog site was taken from <a href="https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/">&ldquo;Make a Hugo Blog from Scratch&rdquo;</a>. I really liked it for its minimalistic style, but it lacked some features. That being the case, I have changed to the theme <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/pulp/">Pulp</a>.  It just works.</p>
