<p>Japan, with a population of about 127 million people, has a seemingly insignificant number of fellowshipping, growing disciples of Christ.  The Japanese people are considered one of the largest unreached people groups in the world and are desperately in need prayer and of workers.  Pray that the Lord of the harvest would send out workers.  Pray that the believers here would grow and recognize their responsibility as disciples to disciple others.</p>
