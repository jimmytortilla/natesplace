<p>Remember the movie “Alien”? I still remember watching it as a kid at a friend’s house and being really, really scared. I think the most frightening thing about it was simply the thought of having a large parasite living inside of one’s gut. Or perhaps it was the idea of that parasite one day deciding to make its way out. Thankfully, besides the occasional tapeworm, human beings do not have to deal with very large creatures living inside of (or forcing their way out of) our bodies.</p>

<p>Enter Nematomorpha:  If you were a large insect, such as a preying mantis, a grasshopper, or a cockroach, you would, if you had any imagination, have good reason for concern. You would very likely someday end up hosting a NEMATOMORPHA or <em>Gordian worm</em>, which when full-grown can be several times longer than the host AND which can share a host with a few others of the same make and model!</p>

<p>As part of the Gordian worm’s life/reproductive cycle, when a worm comes of age, it forces its host (victim)–by what means I do not know–to cast itself into a puddle, pool, or some other body of water, apparently by making it feel thirsty. The worm then pulls an “Alien” move and exits its host’s body. Thankfully, unless the host is a crush or crunch or splat victim, it leaves by the existing exit route.
Today I came across a nice, fat preying mantis in our yard and thought I would see what would happen if I gave it the opportunity to take a nice, long drink from a mason jar. Here are the results:</p>
