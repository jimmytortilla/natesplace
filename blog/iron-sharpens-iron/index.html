<h2 id="bamboo-fishing-poles">Bamboo Fishing Poles</h2>

<p>Last month was my second son&rsquo;s tenth birthday. Yay! For his birthday he really wanted to go fishing, but we didn&rsquo;t have any fishing gear at all. I wondered what to do. We could just buy a Chinese-made bamboo fishing pole from the hundred-yen shop&ndash;think &ldquo;dollar store&rdquo;&ndash;but that would be a boring way to go about it, and the pole would last a day (<em>maybe</em>) in the hands of an excited ten-year-old. Or we could shell out the bucks and buy a &ldquo;real&rdquo; fishing pole and think of it as an investment. Neither idea seemed worthwhile to me. Then it came to me: &ldquo;Why not make our own fishing poles from the bamboo in the grove behind our house?&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s just what we did.</p>

<p>In order to make our poles we didn&rsquo;t need a whole lot of equipment or materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>a handsaw</li>
<li>a bamboo hatchet</li>
<li>a bamboo shaping knife or two (really, mini bamboo hatchets)</li>
<li>some standing bamboo</li>
</ul>

<p>After felling the bamboo, all we really needed to do was to cut the the top ten feet or so off of the bamboos with the saw and then trim off the branches with the saw and the hatchet. Then we needed to smooth up the joints with a bamboo shaping knife. It didn&rsquo;t take all day; but if I had first sharpened the hatchet and the knives we could have cut off the branches in no time flat.</p>

<p>We were ready to go except for a few other necessities for fishing:</p>

<ul>
<li>a line</li>
<li>a weight</li>
<li>a hook</li>
</ul>

<p>For the line didn&rsquo;t we just use nylon fishing line? Nope. We were doing things the old-fashioned way, and nothing less than sturdy cotton kite string would do. For the weight a small hex nut was perfect. But for the hook we needed to be creative. We needed that unsung hero of the stationary shop, the paper clip.</p>

<p>To make reasonably sharp and hardened fishhooks out of ordinary and pliable paper clips we needed a few more things:</p>

<ul>
<li>a butane torch</li>
<li>an iron file</li>
<li>a pair of needle-nosed pliars</li>
<li>a cup of cold water</li>
</ul>

<p>We formed the hooks out of portions of paperclips that we bent into fishhook shapes.  Then we hardened them by heating them to red-hot with the torch (of the ordinary barbeque type) and then dipping them quickly into the cold water.  After this we simply filed the points down with a hundred-yen iron file.  Just that simple!</p>

<p>Then we went fishing!  We had a great time, went through several grasshoppers and crickets (bait), and came home feeling great about having possibly fed some fish.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-the-title-iron-sharpens-iron">So why the title &ldquo;Iron Sharpens Iron&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>Just consider some of the tools we needed in order to make the poles and the hooks:  The saw, the hatchet, the knives, and even the needle-nosed pliars (the snipper part) had very likely all been shaped and sharpened at some point in their histories by something or some things made from iron.  Yes, I realize that grinders and whetstones were also probably used; but If we were to travel through time and space back to the various shops and factories in which these tools were made or the places in which they were used, we would soon see that iron sharpened iron then.  It still does so today.</p>

<p>If I had thought of it&ndash;and I didn&rsquo;t&ndash;and if I had had a bit more confidence in my sharpening technique&ndash;and I don&rsquo;t&ndash;I would have sharpened the iron hatchet and iron bamboo knives with the very file that we used to file the steal (iron based) paper clip fishhooks.  With that file made of iron I could have saved myself a lot of time and sweat when cutting and smoothing the bamboo poles.  I could have made my tools more effective.  Iron sharpens iron.</p>

<p><strong>A Few Observations on Iron Sharpening Iron</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>There must be two items:  One iron item alone cannot sharpen itself.</p></li>

<li><p>Iron tools can be used sharpen other iron tools, making the tool which was sharpened a more effective tool.</p></li>

<li><p>In order for iron to sharpen iron, one tool must be harder than the other.  Though made of iron&ndash;the same substance&ndash;the properties of the tools must be different.</p></li>

<li><p>For iron to sharpen iron, there must be abrasion.</p></li>

<li><p>For iron to effectively sharpen iron there must be force, effort, intention, and technique involved.</p></li>

<li><p>For iron to sharpen iron there must be some loss on the part of the item being sharpened.</p></li>

<li><p>Iron can easily blunt iron.</p></li>

<li><p>A sharp tool or implement is useful.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Few Observations on a Man Sharpening another Man</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>No one can become become more effective on his own.</p></li>

<li><p>We have gifts which God has given us which we can (and should) use to help others grow, to make them more effective.</p></li>

<li><p>The <em>sharpening</em> happens between people who have different strengths, weaknesses, giftings, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>Being <em>sharpened</em> can be painful and involve the removal of something.</p></li>

<li><p>Helping others to grow requires energy, effort, thought, and skill.  In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t just happen.</p></li>

<li><p>The same <em>iron</em> which can <em>sharpen</em> can also <em>blunt</em> and <em>dull</em>:  We must be careful in how we <em>sharpen</em> others.</p></li>

<li><p>Through <em>sharpening</em> others and being <em>sharpened</em> ourselves the church is built up.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So What do I Do about It?</strong></p>

<p>As this blog entry has grown out of proportion, I will leave some possible personal answers to that question for another blog post.  How about you?  How do you plan to make yourself available to sharpen others and/or to be sharpened by others?</p>

<p>(*Note: I found one person with a <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/what-if-iron-sharpening-iron-in-the-book-of-proverbs-is-actually-something-to-avoid/">different understanding</a> about Proverbs 27:17; however, I have not been able to find any other Bible commentator who held this perspective regarding &ldquo;sharpen&rdquo;.  Email me if you do.</p>
