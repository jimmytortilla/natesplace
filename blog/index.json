        "body": " So what is Sozi? Sozi is the name of a software program which allows us to make make an SVG (scaleable vector graphic) into an animated slideshow via HTML.\nToday I want to spend very short amount of time to see if I can embed a Sozi built presentation into this blog post.\nHere goes! First: Create an SVG.   This SVG image was created with Inkscape.   Second: Open the SVG in Sozi and make a slideshow. Making the slideshow in Sozi took about three minutes. It can almost all be done with a mouse once you have your SVG ready and opened in the program.\nThird: Put the following code in my blog post.  \u0026lt;div style=\u0026quot;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;/sozi/sozitest.html#\u0026quot; frameborder=\u0026quot;0\u0026quot; allowfullscreen style=\u0026quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  Fourth: Look at the results below. (By left-clicking within the frame you can speed to the next slide.)   Once you get the hang of using Sozi you\u0026rsquo;ll find it quick and simple. I suggest taking a look at their website to learn a bit more. If you have Inkscape, GIMP, and some imagination, Sozi can be used in so many ways. Oh, and BTW, though I am using a Sozi presentation for the first time on line, I have often used my web browser to open Sozi HTML presentation off line. All you really need to make amazing, animated presentations is Inkscape, GIMP, Firefox, and Sozi. The best thing is that each of these programs is under active development and is FREE!\n"

I also set up another website this past week for our church here in Japan, Siloam Intl. Christian church\u0026ndash;in Japanese, of course. Both sites are Github Pages and were built with Hugo using the Ananke theme. Through the experience of getting these two sites set up, I found that I really enjoyed writing the updates and that I am always tempted to write too much and off subject. So why not just start another little site?\nAt first my simple, little blog site was taken from \u0026ldquo;Make a Hugo Blog from Scratch\u0026rdquo;. I really liked it for its minimalistic style, but it lacked some features. That being the case, I have changed to the theme Pulp. It just works.\n"

        "body": " Remember the movie “Alien”? I still remember watching it as a kid at a friend’s house and being really, really scared. I think the most frightening thing about it was simply the thought of having a large parasite living inside of one’s gut. Or perhaps it was the idea of that parasite one day deciding to make its way out. Thankfully, besides the occasional tapeworm, human beings do not have to deal with very large creatures living inside of (or forcing their way out of) our bodies.\nEnter Nematomorpha: If you were a large insect, such as a preying mantis, a grasshopper, or a cockroach, you would, if you had any imagination, have good reason for concern. You would very likely someday end up hosting a NEMATOMORPHA or Gordian worm, which when full-grown can be several times longer than the host AND which can share a host with a few others of the same make and model!\nAs part of the Gordian worm’s life/reproductive cycle, when a worm comes of age, it forces its host (victim)–by what means I do not know–to cast itself into a puddle, pool, or some other body of water, apparently by making it feel thirsty. The worm then pulls an “Alien” move and exits its host’s body. Thankfully, unless the host is a crush or crunch or splat victim, it leaves by the existing exit route. Today I came across a nice, fat preying mantis in our yard and thought I would see what would happen if I gave it the opportunity to take a nice, long drink from a mason jar.

But I wanted to make a simple appeal for those of you who love the Lord Jesus and want to see the light of the gospel shine more brightly in Japan.\nJapan, with a population of about 127 million people, has a seemingly insignificant number of fellowshipping, growing disciples of Christ. The Japanese people are considered one of the largest unreached people groups in the world and are desperately in need prayer and of workers. Pray that the Lord of the harvest would send out workers. Pray that the believers here would grow and recognize their responsibility as disciples to disciple others.\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 video.
