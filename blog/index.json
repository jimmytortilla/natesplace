        "body": " Bamboo Fishing Poles Last month was my second son\u0026rsquo;s tenth birthday. Yay! For his birthday he really wanted to go fishing, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t have any fishing gear at all. I wondered what to do. We could just buy a Chinese-made bamboo fishing pole from the hundred-yen shop\u0026ndash;think \u0026ldquo;dollar store\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;but that would be a boring way to go about it, and the pole would last a day (maybe) in the hands of an excited ten-year-old. Or we could shell out the bucks and buy a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; fishing pole and think of it as an investment. Neither idea seemed worthwhile to me. Then it came to me: \u0026ldquo;Why not make our own fishing poles from the bamboo in the grove behind our house?\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s just what we did.\nIn order to make our poles we didn\u0026rsquo;t need a whole lot of equipment or materials:\n a handsaw a bamboo hatchet a bamboo shaping knife or two (really, mini bamboo hatchets) some standing bamboo  After felling the bamboo, all we really needed to do was to cut the the top ten feet or so off of the bamboos with the saw and then trim off the branches with the saw and the hatchet. Then we needed to smooth up the joints with a bamboo shaping knife. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take all day; but if I had first sharpened the hatchet and the knives we could have cut off the branches in no time flat.\nWe were ready to go except for a few other necessities for fishing:\n a line a weight a hook  For the line didn\u0026rsquo;t we just use nylon fishing line? Nope. We were doing things the old-fashioned way, and nothing less than sturdy cotton kite string would do. For the weight a small hex nut was perfect. But for the hook we needed to be creative. We needed that unsung hero of the stationary shop, the paper clip.\nTo make reasonably sharp and hardened fishhooks out of ordinary and pliable paper clips we needed a few more things:\n a butane torch an iron file a pair of needle-nosed pliars a cup of cold water  We formed the hooks out of portions of paperclips that we bent into fishhook shapes. Then we hardened them by heating them to red-hot with the torch (of the ordinary barbeque type) and then dipping them quickly into the cold water. After this we simply filed the points down with a hundred-yen iron file. Just that simple!\nThen we went fishing! We had a great time, went through several grasshoppers and crickets (bait), and came home feeling great about having possibly fed some fish.\nLeft-click or touch in the space below to fast-forward to the next slide.\n  So why the title \u0026ldquo;Iron Sharpens Iron\u0026rdquo;? Just consider some of the tools we needed in order to make the poles and the hooks: The saw, the hatchet, the knives, and even the needle-nosed pliars (the snipper part) had very likely all been shaped and sharpened at some point in their histories by something or some things made from iron. Yes, I realize that grinders and whetstones were also probably used; but If we were to travel through time and space back to the various shops and factories in which these tools were made or the places in which they were used, we would soon see that iron sharpened iron then. It still does so today.\nIf I had thought of it\u0026ndash;and I didn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026ndash;and if I had had a bit more confidence in my sharpening technique\u0026ndash;and I don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026ndash;I would have sharpened the iron hatchet and iron bamboo knives with the very file that we used to file the steal (iron based) paper clip fishhooks. With that file made of iron I could have saved myself a lot of time and sweat when cutting and smoothing the bamboo poles. I could have made my tools more effective. Iron sharpens iron.\nConsider Proverbs 27:7 Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another. (ESV) A Few Observations on Iron Sharpening Iron\n There must be two items: One iron item alone cannot sharpen itself.\n Iron tools can be used sharpen other iron tools, making the tool which was sharpened a more effective tool.\n In order for iron to sharpen iron, one tool must be harder than the other. Though made of iron\u0026ndash;the same substance\u0026ndash;the properties of the tools must be different.\n For iron to sharpen iron, there must be abrasion.\n For iron to effectively sharpen iron there must be force, effort, intention, and technique involved.\n For iron to sharpen iron there must be some loss on the part of the item being sharpened.\n Iron can easily blunt iron.\n A sharp tool or implement is useful.\n  A Few Observations on a Man Sharpening another Man\n No one can become become more effective on his own.\n We have gifts which God has given us which we can (and should) use to help others grow, to make them more effective.\n The sharpening happens between people who have different strengths, weaknesses, giftings, etc.\n Being sharpened can be painful and involve the removal of something.\n Helping others to grow requires energy, effort, thought, and skill. In other words, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t just happen.\n The same iron which can sharpen can also blunt and dull: We must be careful in how we sharpen others.\n Through sharpening others and being sharpened ourselves the church is built up.\n  So What do I Do about It?\nAs this blog entry has grown out of proportion, I will leave some possible personal answers to that question for another blog post. How about you? How do you plan to make yourself available to sharpen others and/or to be sharpened by others?\n(*Note: I found one person with a different understanding about Proverbs 27:17; however, I have not been able to find any other Bible commentator who held this perspective regarding \u0026ldquo;sharpen\u0026rdquo;. Email me if you do.\n"

        "body": " So what is Sozi? Sozi is the name of a software program which allows us to make make an SVG (scaleable vector graphic) into an animated slideshow via HTML.\nToday I want to spend very short amount of time to see if I can embed a Sozi built presentation into this blog post.\nHere goes! First: Create an SVG.   This SVG image was created with Inkscape.   Second: Open the SVG in Sozi and make a slideshow. Making the slideshow in Sozi took about three minutes. It can almost all be done with a mouse once you have your SVG ready and opened in the program.\nThird: Put the following code in my blog post.  \u0026lt;div style=\u0026quot;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;/sozi/sozitest.html#\u0026quot; frameborder=\u0026quot;0\u0026quot; allowfullscreen style=\u0026quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  Fourth: Look at the results below. (By left-clicking within the frame you can speed to the next slide.)   Once you get the hang of using Sozi you\u0026rsquo;ll find it quick and simple. I suggest taking a look at their website to learn a bit more. If you have Inkscape, GIMP, and some imagination, Sozi can be used in so many ways. Oh, and BTW, though I am using a Sozi presentation for the first time on line, I have often used my web browser to open Sozi HTML presentation off line. All you really need to make amazing, animated presentations is Inkscape, GIMP, Firefox, and Sozi. The best thing is that each of these programs is under active development and is FREE!\n"

I also set up another website this past week for our church here in Japan, Siloam Intl. Christian church\u0026ndash;in Japanese, of course. Both sites are Github Pages and were built with Hugo using the Ananke theme. Through the experience of getting these two sites set up, I found that I really enjoyed writing the updates and that I am always tempted to write too much and off subject. So why not just start another little site?\nAt first my simple, little blog site was taken from \u0026ldquo;Make a Hugo Blog from Scratch\u0026rdquo;. I really liked it for its minimalistic style, but it lacked some features. That being the case, I have changed to the theme Pulp. It just works.\n"

        "body": " Remember the movie “Alien”? I still remember watching it as a kid at a friend’s house and being really, really scared. I think the most frightening thing about it was simply the thought of having a large parasite living inside of one’s gut. Or perhaps it was the idea of that parasite one day deciding to make its way out. Thankfully, besides the occasional tapeworm, human beings do not have to deal with very large creatures living inside of (or forcing their way out of) our bodies.\nEnter Nematomorpha: If you were a large insect, such as a preying mantis, a grasshopper, or a cockroach, you would, if you had any imagination, have good reason for concern. You would very likely someday end up hosting a NEMATOMORPHA or Gordian worm, which when full-grown can be several times longer than the host AND which can share a host with a few others of the same make and model!\nAs part of the Gordian worm’s life/reproductive cycle, when a worm comes of age, it forces its host (victim)–by what means I do not know–to cast itself into a puddle, pool, or some other body of water, apparently by making it feel thirsty. The worm then pulls an “Alien” move and exits its host’s body. Thankfully, unless the host is a crush or crunch or splat victim, it leaves by the existing exit route. Today I came across a nice, fat preying mantis in our yard and thought I would see what would happen if I gave it the opportunity to take a nice, long drink from a mason jar.
